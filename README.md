# 05-Space-Shooter
Space shooter project for game design class.

I attempted to get the character to run towards the right end of the screen to create more of a game scenario, but couldn't figure out how to move the sprite automatically. I used the principles from the bullet and animation exercices to create a spaceship simulation shooter triggered on mouse press.
